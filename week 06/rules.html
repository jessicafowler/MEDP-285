		        <p>
                    Objective: Score more runs than the opposing team. 
                    Teams: Two teams of 9 players (or 10 in some leagues) compete. 
                    Innings: A game typically consists of 7 innings, with each team batting until three outs are made. 
                    Winning: The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins. </p>
        <p>Batting:
            Batting Order:
            Teams bat in a specific order, and players cannot re-enter the batting order once removed. 
            Foul Territory:
            A batted ball that settles in foul territory between home and first base, or home and third base, is a foul ball. 
            Strikeout:
            A batter is out after three strikes. 
            Hit:
            A batter reaches base safely by hitting the ball into fair territory and running to first base, or by virtue of a fielder's choice, or a fielding error. 
            Base Running:
            Base Touching: Runners must touch each base in order. 
            Overrunning Bases: Runners may overrun first base only. 
            Stealing Bases: Softball players can steal bases, but they must stay on base until the pitcher releases the ball. 
            Outs: A runner is out if they are tagged with the ball while off a base, or if a fielder tags a base with the ball before a runner reaches it in a force out situation. </p>

	    		<h2>Pitching</h2>
		        <p>Pitching:
                    Underhand Pitch: Softball is played with an underhand pitch. 
                    Pitching Circle: The pitcher throws from within a designated pitching circle. 
                    Strike Zone: The strike zone is the area between the batter's shoulders and knees when they are standing in a natural batting stance. 
                    Balls and Strikes: A pitch that is not swung at and doesn't pass through the strike zone is a ball. A pitch that is swung at and missed, or that passes through the strike zone and is not swung at, is a strike. 
                    Walk: After four balls are thrown to a batter, they are awarded first base. </p>
