                        <h3>&diams;A Portryal of Female Struggle</h3>

                        <p>
                            The women of the Sopranos are not there to be used as plot development or sexualized. They face their own real struggles which are highlighted as their own plot lines. The show goes into depth about the way these female charcters feel and the emotions the Mafia lifestyle causes them.

                        <h3>&diams;Media Representation</h3>

                        <p>
                            The Sopranos introduces a level of female character recognition in the mafia entertainment genre that is not typically explored. The show portrays the women’s raw feelings, wants, desires, and thoughts and delves into their motives and struggles with morale and loyalty. This differs from most mafia, and male-centered media in general, by examining the effects the men’s actions have on the women’s lives, the women’s interactions and relationships with eachother, and the women’s actions that drive the show’s plot and characters, instead of just being an asset to the men’s characters. Many times, women are portrayed in such media as a means to satisfy male viewers, or allude to the idea that the male character is successful in his romantic life. We do not often see the aftermath of male and female interactions in this type of media, unless it is the man’s point of view.

                        <h3>&diams;A Harsh Reality</h3>

                        <p>
                            Although the treatment of female characters by the male characters in the show is not usually respectable, it is admirable for The Sopranos to showcase this reality. I love how The Sopranos depicts the women’s battles with their strong desire to stay loyal, despite their unloyal husbands and their longing for independence and self-worth. The Sopranos does not skimp on showing the harsh realities of the way the women live, and it does a great job at highlighting the issues this lifestyle has for them.
