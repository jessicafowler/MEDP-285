    <h2>What is a picnic? And why are they so cool? :</h2>
        <p>
            A picnic is an event to eat outdoors, have a break, enjoy the warm sunshine, and have fun in a free time. It is usually held in a park or other open places. People bring the food for picnics in lunch boxes or in picnic baskets. Food for picnics is prepared on location such as by grilling, or at home. After the meal, people often play games and sports, for example, playing catch, badminton and Frisbee!
