        <h2>Color</h2>

            <p>
            Red is the first color babies can see after black and white. (Hunter Labs)
            </p>

            <p>Many world leaders have worn red to symbolize their power. Princess Elizabeth I wore a red dress and coif in her portrait to symbolize political and moral strength. In Chinese philosophy, red is associated with fire and connected to aggression, confidence and leadership. (Hunter Labs)</p>

            <p>Red provokes strong, often opposing emotions, such as love and anger. It conveys literal danger, such as stop signs and traffic lights, and metaphorical danger, such as “red flags” or being “in the red.” Exposure to the color red can cause increased blood pressure, respiration rate, heart rate and metabolism. (Hunter Labs)</p>

        <h2>Hue</h2>

          <p>Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy. (Wikipeadia)</p>

        <h2>Saturation</h2>

            <p>Saturation defines the brilliance and intensity of a color. When a pigment hue is “toned,” both white and black (grey) are added to the color to reduce the color’s saturation. In terms of the “additive” light color model, though, saturation works on a scale based on how much or how little other hues are represented in the color. (Leigh Cotnoir)

        <h2>Brightness</h2>

            <p>Electric Red is the brightest possible red that can be reproduced on a computer monitor. This color is an approximation of an orangish red spectral color. (Wikipeadia)</p>

        <h2>Concept</h2>

            <p>More than 40,000 years ago, hunters and gatherers used red clay to make paint. The Paleolithic people buried their dead with red powder for protection from evil spirits. Red is also common in ancient art, with cave paintings across continents created by red ochre. Ancient Romans favored cinnabar for decorations, and Renaissance painters used vermilion paint. (Hunter Labs)</p>

        <h2>Culture</h2>

            <p>Kings in the Middle Ages wore red to display their God-given right to the throne. (Hunter Labs)</p>
            <p>The color red is significant in many cultures. It is associated with love in Western culture, and it symbolizes good fortune and joy in Asian cultures. For this reason, it’s a prominent color in Asian weddings to bring love, fertility and good luck. (Hunter Labs)</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>

            <p>Red pigment comes from the deep red ink gathered from cochineal insects. Farmers in Central and South America harvest these bugs from the prickly pear cactus and smash them into a grainy red substance. This substance is processed into a powder or liquid. The Aztecs invented this technique in the 15th century. This practice is one of many organic and synthetic methods of making red pigment. (Hunter Labs)</p>
            <p>Since the bugs are so small, nearly 70,000 of them are required to produce one pound of dye. This dye appears as carmine, natural Red 4 or cochineal extract in ingredient lists on food labels. It’s also common in cosmetics. (Hunter Labs)</p>

        <h2>Symbolism</h2>

            <p>Because red grabs attention, it’s used to warn people of danger. That’s why it’s on stop signs, traffic lights and fire engines. (Hunter Labs)</p>
            <p>In fashion, the designer brand Christian Louboutin is known for its red-soled shoes. (Hunter Labs)</p>

        <h2>Color Spectrum</h2>

            <p>"At one of the longest wavelengths, red is easy for humans to identify. A color spectrophotometer measures the color red by using sensors to separate transmitted or reflected light beams into their component wavelengths. These numerical values for the red shade determine if the production processes create consistent results." (Hunter Labs)</p>
