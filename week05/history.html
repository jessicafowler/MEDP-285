                <h2>Color</h2>

            <p>
            Red is the first color babies can see after black and white. 
            </p>

            <p>Many world leaders have worn red to symbolize their power. Princess Elizabeth I wore a red dress and coif in her portrait to symbolize political and moral strength. In Chinese philosophy, red is associated with fire and connected to aggression, confidence and leadership. </p>

            <p>Red provokes strong, often opposing emotions, such as love and anger. It conveys literal danger, such as stop signs and traffic lights, and metaphorical danger, such as “red flags” or being “in the red.” Exposure to the color red can cause increased blood pressure, respiration rate, heart rate and metabolism.</p>

                    <h2>Hue</h2>

          <p>Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy. </p>

        <h2>Saturation</h2>

            <p>Saturation defines the brilliance and intensity of a color. When a pigment hue is “toned,” both white and black (grey) are added to the color to reduce the color’s saturation. In terms of the “additive” light color model, though, saturation works on a scale based on how much or how little other hues are represented in the color.

                    <h2>Concept</h2>

                    <p>More than 40,000 years ago, hunters and gatherers used red clay to make paint. The Paleolithic people buried their dead with red powder for protection from evil spirits. Red is also common in ancient art, with cave paintings across continents created by red ochre. Ancient Romans favored cinnabar for decorations, and Renaissance painters used vermilion paint. </p>

                <h2>Culture</h2>

                <p>Kings in the Middle Ages wore red to display their God-given right to the throne. (Hunter Labs)</p>
                <p>The color red is significant in many cultures. It is associated with love in Western culture, and it symbolizes good fortune and joy in Asian cultures. For this reason, it’s a prominent color in Asian weddings to bring love, fertility and good luck. </p>
