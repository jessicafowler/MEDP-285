		        <p>Putting Players Out
					A batter is out if:
					They hit the ball and it’s caught while it’s in the air (even if it’s caught in foul territory), gets 3
					strikes.
					A runner is out if:
					they are hit by a batted ball while off a base, a fielder tags her with the ball when they’re not
					touching a base, they run more than 3 feet out of the baseline to avoid being tagged, a fielder
					with the ball tags a base at which there is a force play before the forced runner reaches the
					base, they fail to tag up and is thrown out, they run past a base runner that’s ahead of them.
					Double play - When 2 players get out on the same play.
					Steal - When a runner runs to the next base without the ball being hit. The runner may not
					leave the base until after the pitcher releases the ball. The runner is out if she is tagged with the
					ball before reaching the base.
					Tagging up – When a fielder catches a fly ball, a runner cannot leave the base until after the ball
					hits the fielder’s glove. If they leave the base too early, they have to go back and touch the base
					before they can run to the next base. If the ball gets to the base before they return to tag up,
					they are out.</p>
